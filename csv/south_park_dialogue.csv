10,1,Chef,Yeah
10,1,Mrs. Garrison,"But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore"
10,1,Chef,Nnono
10,1,Randy,"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again"
10,1,Chef,That's right
10,1,Randy,"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right"
10,1,Chef,That's right. Randy!
10,1,Jimbo,"Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house"

10,1,Chef,You bet! Good-bye. Children!
10,1,Stan,"Right. Uh, see ya"
10,1,Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you"
10,1,Stan,"Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little"
10,1,Kyle,Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good"
10,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, me too."
10,1,A Boy,"It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me"
10,1,Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again"
10,1,Kyle,Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!
10,1,Clyde,"You guys, you guys"
10,1,Stan,What
10,1,Clyde,Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff
10,1,Kyle,Like what
10,1,Clyde,I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me
10,1,Stan,What?
10,1,Clyde,I gotta- I gotta go.
10,1,Kyle,Weirdo.
10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children"
10,1,The Boys,Hey Chef
10,1,Chef,How's it goin'
10,1,Kyle,Good
10,1,Chef,"Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love"
10,1,Cartman,Excuse me
10,1,Chef,"Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love"
10,1,Kyle,...Chef?? A-are you okay
10,1,Chef,"I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle"
10,1,Stan,"Dude, what are you saying?"
10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children"
10,1,Stan,...WHAT?
10,1,Det. Jarvis,"Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef"
10,1,Kyle,This doesn't make any sense
10,1,Det. Jarvis,We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile
10,1,Stan,"No, he's not"
10,1,Det. Jarvis,Uh huh
10,1,Stan,"No, he's not"
10,1,Det. Jarvis,"Yeah, yeah he is so"
10,1,Butters,What's a pedophile
10,1,Det. Jarvis,"Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef,  so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here?"
10,1,Stan,NO
10,1,Det. Jarvis,"Okay, did he touch you here?"
10,1,The Class,NO
10,1,Det. Jarvis,Did he ever do this? How about this?
10,1,Butters,My Uncle Bud did that to me once!
10,1,Det. Jarvis,Did Chef ever try one of these on for size?
10,1,Kyle,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here"
10,1,Det. Jarvis,"Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh"
10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, the police are asking questions about you"
10,1,Chef,"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love"
10,1,Stan,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you"
10,1,Chef,"Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black as"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?"
10,1,Chef,"I specializes in your asshole, Kyle."
10,1,Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex"
10,1,Kyle,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things"
10,1,Kenny,(Like what?
10,1,Kyle,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex"
10,1,Stan,Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him
10,1,Kenny,(Yeah! I think...
10,1,Cartman,Yeah
10,1,Kyle,"All right, come on guys"
10,1,Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs."
10,1,Butler,May I help you
10,1,Kyle,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something"
10,1,Butler,Right this way.
10,1,Head Adventurer,"Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a"
10,1,Butler,"Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you"
10,1,Head Adventurer,"Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club"
10,1,Club Members,Tally ho
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Indeed
10,1,Kyle,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids."
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does"
10,1,Cartman,...Huh
10,1,Marksman,We travel the world and have sex with children
10,1,Marine,"Yes, what else would we do"
10,1,Kyle,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit"
10,1,Kyle,...Dude
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club"
10,1,Stan,NO!
10,1,Mr. Connolly,No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?  How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club?
10,1,Stan,No!
10,1,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then"
10,1,Kyle,Just what the hell is that thing?
10,1,Mr. Connolly,What? What thing? I don't see anything
10,1,Kyle,HA! I knew it
10,1,Stan,Knew what
10,1,Kyle,The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club
10,1,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch"
10,1,Chef,"Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love"
10,1,Stan,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good"
10,1,Chef,I just like to make love up your butt
10,1,Woman,Oh my God
10,1,Nurse,"Mr. Chef, is it"
10,1,Kyle,"All right, come on."
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today"
10,1,Kyle,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,Brainwashed
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking
10,1,Stan,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah"
10,1,Chef,"Doctor, do you have- children"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Why, yes, I have two young boys"
10,1,Chef,Have you all been sodomizing your children too
10,1,Dr. Neeland,You say he's never been like this before
10,1,Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool"
10,1,Chef,I'm gonna make love to the children
10,1,Dr. Neeland,He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen
10,1,Cartman,So what can we do?
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process"
10,1,Kyle,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children"
10,1,Stan,Having sex with women
10,1,Dr. Neeland,Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away
10,1,DJ,"All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique"
10,1,Chef,"Aw, come on, children. Let's go home"
10,1,Stan,This isn't working
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Well let's... give it some more time, kids."
10,1,Stripper,Would you like to daaance??
10,1,Kyle,No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend
10,1,Stripper,Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance??
10,1,Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance"
10,1,Blonde,"Up yours, fatty"
10,1,Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off"
10,1,DJ,"All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay!"
10,1,Stan,"Come on guys, we might as well go."
10,1,Chef,God-damn
10,1,Stan,"Chef, we're leaving"
10,1,Dr. Neeland,"Nono, wait. Let him go."
10,1,Spontaneous Bootay,"Come here, chubby."
10,1,Chef,Wait a minute
10,1,Stan,He's remembering
10,1,Chef,Children! What have I done
10,1,Cartman,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember"
10,1,Chef,I'm goinna- I'm gonna
10,1,Kyle,"Come on, Chef! You can do it"
10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire"
10,1,The Boys,Yay
10,1,Kenny,(Chef!
10,1,Chef,"Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Great shot, William! Hit him with another."
10,1,Chef,Oh!
10,1,The Boys,Chef
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls"
10,1,Stan,Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?
10,1,Mr. Connolly,He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done
10,1,Cartman,"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life"
10,1,Stan,"Oh Jesus, here we go"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club
10,1,Stan,We don't wanna hear it
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal"
10,1,Stan,Immortal
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892."
10,1,Kyle,...Do you realize how retarded that sounds
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave."
10,1,Stan,We're not leaving without Chef
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating"
10,1,Kyle,We're not going anywhere without Chef
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door"
10,1,Guard 1,"All right, come on kids"
10,1,Kyle,No! Hey
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha
10,1,Stan,"No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room"
10,1,Guard 2,This is their house and they don't want you here.
10,1,Kyle,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend"
10,1,William,And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills.
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, come on"
10,1,Chef,Children
10,1,William,Get out of here
10,1,Cartman,Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash
10,1,Kenny,(Yeeeeehah!)
10,1,Stan,"Come on, Chef"
10,1,Chef,I can't... break these locks.
10,1,Kyle,Here!
10,1,Cartman,Run Chef
10,1,Mr. Connolly,What the-? Impossible! I made them leave
10,1,Kyle,Get outside!
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Stop them!
10,1,Chef,Children! Run!
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Stop!
10,1,Stan,We made it
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place??
10,1,Stan,"Chef, come on"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty
10,1,Kyle,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL"
10,1,Stan,"Chef, we love you"
10,1,Chef,I'm sorry children.
10,1,Kyle,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that?"
10,1,Chef,"Get the hell out of here, children!"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO!
10,1,The Boys,Chef!
10,1,Chef,Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww!
10,1,Stan,NO!
10,1,Cartman,A mountain lion!
10,1,Mr. Connolly,We can't lose another member! Shoot it!
10,1,Chef,Ah
10,1,Marksman,"All right, this!"
10,1,Kyle,CHEF!
10,1,Cartman,A grizzly bear
10,1,Stan,Oh my God... They killed Chef
10,1,Kyle,You bastards. YOU BASTARDS
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester.
10,1,Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your"
10,1,Chef,POOOT!
10,1,Cartman,Oh never mind
10,1,Stan,"Come on, let's go."
10,1,Kyle,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains"
10,1,Randy,Yeah
10,1,Mr. Mackey,He's right.
10,1,Kyle,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all."
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Is it working? Is it working
10,1,Tech,Yes. We've got a pulse
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something"
10,1,Darth Chef,"Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Yes, go on"
10,1,Darth Chef,"And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy
10,1,Darth Chef,"No, I mean my balls"
10,1,Mr. Connolly,"Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa"
10,2,Gerald,"Hey there, Richard"
10,2,Richard,"Oh, hey Gerald. New car"
10,2,Gerald,Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore
10,2,Richard,Well... Good for you
10,2,Gerald,Oho...  Thanks.
10,2,Stephen,"Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski"
10,2,Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else"
10,2,Gerald,"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!"
10,2,Driver,"Hey, is that a hybrid"
10,2,Gerald,"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see"
10,2,Driver,"Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you"
10,2,Gerald,Thanks
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death."
10,2,Gerald,"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot"
10,2,Kyle,What?
10,2,Gerald,"Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, can we go home, please"
10,2,Gerald,"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle"
10,2,Kyle,"But Dad, I want"
10,2,Gerald,"NOW, KYLE!"
10,2,Stan,Oh hey Kyle
10,2,Kyle,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here"
10,2,Stan,Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing
10,2,Kyle,Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.
10,2,Randy,What's this?
10,2,Gerald,Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket
10,2,Randy,"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?"
10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a"
10,2,Randy,"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?"
10,2,Gerald,"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket"
10,2,Randy,I know it's not a real ticket!
10,2,Jimbo,"Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?!"
10,2,Gerald,"Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon"
10,2,Jimbo,"Well thanks, Officer Dickhole"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, let's just go"
10,2,Gerald,"Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem"
10,2,Randy,"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts"
10,2,Gerald,"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was ""high and mighty"" to  care about the earth"
10,2,Randy,And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do
10,2,Gerald,"Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the"
10,2,Randy,"There, like that! Stop that"
10,2,Darryl,Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck
10,2,Gerald,"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots!"
10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you"
10,2,Gerald,"Yes, it certainly is"
10,2,Kyle,We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...
10,2,Ike,Take offense
10,2,Kyle,...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...
10,2,Ike,Alienated
10,2,Kyle,...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends
10,2,Gerald,"Well, I totally agree, Kyle"
10,2,Kyle,You do?
10,2,Gerald,Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars
10,2,Kyle,"Righ!  Okay, good"
10,2,Gerald,"And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE"
10,2,Kyle,What?
10,2,Gerald,"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!"
10,2,Stan,Yeah?
10,2,Butters,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle"
10,2,Stan,Going away party? What do you mean
10,2,Butters,Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away
10,2,Stan,Moving away?? Kyle can't move away
10,2,Butters,Well he is
10,2,Stan,Where's the going-away party
10,2,Butters,At Cartman's house
10,2,Cartman,Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER!
10,2,Token,"Hey Eric, where's Kyle"
10,2,Cartman,Who?
10,2,Clyde,"Kyle, the person leaving"
10,2,Cartman,Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle
10,2,Craig,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away"
10,2,Stan,Kyle? Kyle
10,2,Clyde,Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him
10,2,Stan,What?
10,2,Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle"
10,2,Stan,Kyle! Du-what is going on?
10,2,Kyle,My Dad says he can't live here anymore
10,2,Stan,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend"
10,2,Gerald,"I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs"
10,2,Stan,Well... Maybe they'll change
10,2,Gerald,"I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car!"
10,2,Stan,Nooo
10,2,Gerald,"Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind."
10,2,Stan,I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it
10,2,Gerald,"Well? What do you think, huh?"
10,2,Sheila,"Oh Gerald, it's beautiful"
10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house."
10,2,Man,"Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors"
10,2,Gerald,Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis
10,2,Man,"Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood"
10,2,Sheila,Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat
10,2,Peter,"Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down"
10,2,Man 2,"You in here, Peter"
10,2,Peter,"Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovski"
10,2,Paul,"Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallaha"
10,2,Gerald and Sheila,Hello
10,2,Paul,"We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right"
10,2,Gerald,Yeah. That's right
10,2,Peter,"Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner"
10,2,Gerald,"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh"
10,2,Peter,"Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here"
10,2,Paul,"Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  Ahhh,  ahh,  ahh.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisc"
10,2,Gerald,Yeah. We sure are
10,2,Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now."
10,2,Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing"
10,2,Stan,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways"
10,2,Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh"
10,2,Stan,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs"
10,2,Cartman,Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him
10,2,Stan,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow"
10,2,Cartman,"Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!"
10,2,Butters,Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew.
10,2,Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now"
10,2,DJ,"All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with ""Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already""."
10,2,Stan,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now"
10,2,Customer,He's right.
10,2,Stan,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people no"
10,2,Jimbo,"Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know"
10,2,Jimbo,Thanks.
10,2,Mrs. Garrison,Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids?
10,2,Randy,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay"
10,2,Driver 1,Good for you
10,2,Driver 2,Thanks
10,2,Randy,At least we're smart enough to know better
10,2,Driver 3,Thanks!
10,2,Stan,"Come on, everybody be people no"
10,2,Speaker,And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country!
10,2,Richard,If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are
10,2,Stan,"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now."
10,2,Jimbo,Great speech
10,2,Gerald,"Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some"
10,2,An officer,"Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song"
10,2,Stan,Yeah
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Uhh!
10,2,Stan,Ow
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?
10,2,Stan,What?
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Come with me!
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,There! Look!
10,2,Stan,Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug"
10,2,Stan,Smug
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America"
10,2,Announcer,This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin
10,2,Anchor Tom,It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan
10,2,Keenan,"Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country"
10,2,Singer,A smuggy day in San Francisco town
10,2,Paul,"Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian"
10,2,Sheila,"No! Hello, how are you"
10,2,Gail,"Really good, really good."
10,2,Gerald,"Hey there. Alan, right"
10,2,Alan,"Actually, it's Alai"
10,2,Gerald,"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine"
10,2,Alan,Can I just get an empty glass
10,2,Gerald,Oh. Sure.
10,2,Alan,Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death.
10,2,Kyle,So... what do you do for fun
10,2,Brian,We drink and take drugs
10,2,Boy 1,Do you want some acid
10,2,Kyle,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff"
10,2,Boy 2,You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs
10,2,Brian,It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time
10,2,Gerald,"Everything okay in here, Kyle"
10,2,Kyle,"Yeah, fine, Dad"
10,2,Gerald,"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm"
10,2,Kyle,Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid
10,2,Ike,I want three
10,2,Stan,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there"
10,2,Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football"
10,2,Butters,Yeah. You're right.
10,2,Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew"
10,2,Butters,"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th"
10,2,Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole"
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Marsh
10,2,Stan,"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly"
10,2,Cartman,Who
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse
10,2,Keenan,I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength
10,2,Cartman,The smug
10,2,Keenan,"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this."
10,2,Stan,What is that
10,2,Keenan,It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards
10,2,Stan,George Clooney's acceptance speech
10,2,Keenan,"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction"
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm
10,2,Stan,What about San Francisco
10,2,Keenan,"Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco"
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen"
10,2,Randy,Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes."
10,2,Jimbo,This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids
10,2,Randy,"Yeah. Good going, stupid"
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town"
10,2,Stephen,Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!
10,2,Jimbo,Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!
10,2,Randy,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?"
10,2,Stan,I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco
10,2,Randy,Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,How long do we have until the smug clouds collide
10,2,Keenan,Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona
10,2,Attendant,The hell is that?
10,2,Butters,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this"
10,2,Cartman,I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits
10,2,Butters,But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city
10,2,Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength"
10,2,Butters,"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric"
10,2,Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes."
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up"
10,2,Stan,Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!  Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?"
10,2,Keenan,"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time"
10,2,Man,"Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan"
10,2,Cartman,"Butters, are you there?"
10,2,Butters,"I'm here, Eric"
10,2,Cartman,I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL
10,2,Butters,You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left
10,2,Cartman,Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store
10,2,Butters,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west"
10,2,Cartman,Turning right at O two four niner.
10,2,Randy,That's it. That's that the last one
10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid"
10,2,Keenan,"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us"
10,2,Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?"
10,2,Butters,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here"
10,2,Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go"
10,2,Gerald,Being smug is a good thing.
10,2,Cartman,Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle
10,2,Kyle,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls"
10,2,Ike,I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls
10,2,Cartman,We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!!
10,2,Network Anchor,"And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole"
10,2,Stan,No..
10,2,Randy,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend"
10,2,Clyde,"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see"
10,2,Stan,What
10,2,Clyde,It's a miracle
10,2,Stan,Kyle
10,2,Kyle,Hey Stan
10,2,Stan,"Dude, what happened??"
10,2,Gerald,We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay?"
10,2,Stan,"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead"
10,2,Richard,So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild
10,2,Randy,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars"
10,2,Gerald,"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right?"
10,2,Kyle,NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay"
10,2,Kyle,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it"
10,2,Randy,You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it
10,2,Kyle,Yeah
10,2,Randy,I'm...  I'm not ready..
10,2,Gerald,I don't think I can do it either
10,2,Mr. Mackey,It's simply asking too much
10,2,Randy,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us"
10,2,Gerald,"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers!"
10,2,Cartman,"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle"
10,2,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess so"
10,2,Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat"
10,2,Kyle,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!"
10,2,Cartman,"Ah, that's better."
10,3,Sharon,But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel.
10,3,Randy,STAAAN!
10,3,Stan,What?? What?
10,3,Randy,"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!"
10,3,Shelly,Whats going on dad
10,3,Randy,JUST GET THE GUN!!
10,3,Randy,"Unh, come on!"
10,3,Man,AWWWGH
10,3,Woman,Oh nooo!
10,3,Stan,Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?
10,3,Kyle,I have no idea
10,3,Man,Take cover in the community center again
10,3,Jimbo,"All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door"
10,3,Linda,"Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters."
10,3,Stephen,"We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him"
10,3,Stan,"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?!"
10,3,Randy,A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!
10,3,Stan,Sso
10,3,Randy,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore"
10,3,Gerald,Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character
10,3,Randy,Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy
10,3,Crowd,AWWW
10,3,Jimbo,How could Family Guy do that
10,3,Sheila,Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims
10,3,Randy,Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money
10,3,Stan,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon?"
10,3,Mr. Mackey,Wu-we've got the TV working!
10,3,Tom,"Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy"
10,3,Sharon,"Oh Randy, hold me."
10,3,Tom,"The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement"
10,3,al-Zawahri,"We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation"
10,3,Linda,So what happens now
10,3,Randy,"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead"
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,It's okay!
10,3,Randy,We're alive?? We're alive!
10,3,Jimbo,"Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute"
10,3,Crowd,Oh thank God
10,3,Randy,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet"
10,3,Stan,They censored the image of Mohammad? How
10,3,Kyle,I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did
10,3,Kyle,"Okay you guys, check it out."
10,3,Cartman,You TIVO every episode of Family Guy
10,3,Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show"
10,3,Stan,"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy"
10,3,Cartman,Yich.
10,3,Lois,"Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner"
10,3,Peter,You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car?
10,3,Peter,"Hey there, Knight Rider."
10,3,Michael,"After those bad guys, KITT!"
10,3,Chris,"Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner"
10,3,Stewie,Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous
10,3,Peter,Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain?
10,3,Peter,"Pancakes for you, Captain"
10,3,Soccer Captain,"I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille."
10,3,Peter,Love will keep us togethe
10,3,Kyle,"Hehaha, heh"
10,3,Cartman,Yich
10,3,Lois,"But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend"
10,3,Peter,"Well, maybe we can just have tea"
10,3,Brian,"You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith?"
10,3,Peter,"Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea."
10,3,Mr. T,"Try my ""Mr. T. ...tea."""
10,3,Peter,"Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh"
10,3,Kyle,That's it? That's all they did
10,3,Cartman,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool"
10,3,Stan,What? What's the big deal
10,3,Cartman,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?"
10,3,Kyle,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?"
10,3,Stan,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time"
10,3,Cartman,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?"
10,3,Kyle,Uhhh..
10,3,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong!"
10,3,Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?"
10,3,Peter,"Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake"
10,3,Sheila,"Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something!"
10,3,Kyle,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ"
10,3,Gerald,It's okay... it's dead
10,3,Sheila,You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show
10,3,Kyle,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea"
10,3,Sheila,You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad"
10,3,Kyle,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad"
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, you're not being very sensitive"
10,3,Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't"
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Let's all look at why Muslims are upset:  First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  Sex. Good.  There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.  Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody?  Jack off.  Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.  And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in?  Good, sand.  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too"
10,3,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy"
10,3,Wendy,...yeah
10,3,Mr. Mackey,Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement
10,3,Stan,The hell's going on now?
10,3,Principal Victoria,"Shh! Quiet, students, quiet"
10,3,SNN Anchor,"Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored"
10,3,Cartman,What
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,Why would they-
10,3,SNN Anchor,FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say
10,3,FOX President,"Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't"
10,3,Randy,FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!
10,3,SNN Anchor,"Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threa"
10,3,al-Zawahri,"Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!"
10,3,Mr. Mackey,Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay
10,3,Cartman,Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war
10,3,Stan,Does this mean we don't have school all week
10,3,Cartman,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something"
10,3,Kenny,(Like what?
10,3,Cartman,We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me
10,3,Stan,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses"
10,3,Cartman,Then we'll ride our Big Wheels
10,3,Stan,To Los Angeles
10,3,Cartman,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down"
10,3,Kyle,Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated
10,3,Cartman,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle"
10,3,Kyle,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real"
10,3,Cartman,"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right."
10,3,Gerald,"Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking"
10,3,Kyle,Dad? Are you sure there's time
10,3,Gerald,"This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities"
10,3,Kyle,No
10,3,Sheila,Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?
10,3,Gerald,He was just here! Ike
10,3,Sheila,Ike!
10,3,Kyle,Ike? Iiike!  Ike!
10,3,Ike,Ice cream. I want chocolate
10,3,Kyle,Ike!  This way!  Iiike!
10,3,Ike,Kyyyle
10,3,Kyle,Nooooo!
10,3,Cartman,Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work.
10,3,Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled"
10,3,Cartman,"Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me."
10,3,Kyle,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before"
10,3,Cartman,"Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time"
10,3,Kyle,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together"
10,3,Cartman,You know we might not even make it into the studio
10,3,Kyle,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that"
10,3,Cartman,So what made you change your mind
10,3,Kyle,I got some sound advice... from an old friend.
10,3,Cartman,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going"
10,3,Kyle,Yeah!
10,3,Cartman,Are you set
10,3,Kyle,I'm set! Let's do this
10,3,Cartman,"All right, let's roll!"
10,3,Mayor McDaniels,"People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic"
10,3,Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days"
10,3,Mayor McDaniels,I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution
10,3,Prof. Thomas,"Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it"
10,3,Jimbo,So how do we do that
10,3,Prof. Thomas,"We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all"
10,3,Stephen,"No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it."
10,3,Randy,I like the sand idea
10,3,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, me too"
10,3,Gerald,Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.
10,3,Mayor McDaniels,"We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people"
10,3,Kyle,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time"
10,3,Cartman,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever"
10,3,Kyle,Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled
10,3,Cartman,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley"
10,3,Kyle,Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever
10,3,Cartman,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong"
10,3,Kyle,But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy
10,3,Cartman,"Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand!"
10,3,Kyle,You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air
10,3,Cartman,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!"
10,3,Kyle,What are you talking about?
10,3,Cartman,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
10,3,Kyle,I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech
10,3,Cartman,Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!
10,3,Kyle,No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air
10,3,Cartman,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw"
10,3,Kyle,What?  CARTMAN!
10,3,Cartman,"Kyle, stop it"
10,3,Cartman,Holy Crap!
10,3,Kyle,Ahhh
10,3,Trooper,"Stay on 'em!  Jesus, Mary!"
10,3,Prof. Thomas,"If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own."
10,3,Stan,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand"
10,3,Randy,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up"
10,3,Stan,Yeah
10,3,Randy,"All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole"
10,3,Stan,"Dad, this is stupid"
10,3,Randy,"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me."
10,3,Jimbo,"Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head"
10,3,Prof. Thomas,"Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand"
10,3,Farmer,I'll do it
10,3,Wife,"Dylan, no"
10,3,Prof. Thomas,"You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience"
10,3,Dylan,"Yes, I know"
10,3,Wife,"Dylan, please, you can't"
10,3,Dylan,"Somebody has to do it, Sarah.  You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right.  You have to understand... I'm all she has."
10,3,Mrs. Garrison,Who are those people
10,3,Kyle,No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH!
10,3,Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle"
10,3,Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?
10,3,Cartman,"Suck mah balls, Kyle!"
10,3,President Bush,Are you the network president
10,3,FOX President,"Yes, Mr. President"
10,3,President Bush,"We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President"
10,3,FOX President,"Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad"
10,3,President Bush,"But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with"
10,3,FOX President,"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know."
10,3,Announcer,Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff
10,3,Cartman,This... explains everything
10,3,Announcer,As an entire nation buries its head in sand...
10,3,SNN Anchor,The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone
10,3,Announcer,...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged..
10,3,Cartman,"Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle"
10,3,Announcer,"Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will Family Guy be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy, next week, on South Park"
